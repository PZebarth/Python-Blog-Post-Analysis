## Project Motivation
I was interested in using Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data to better understand:

### 1. How common is becoming a developer with a physics background?
### 2. What programming languages should you focus on?
### 3. How should you learn the necessary programming languages?

## File Description:
Survey Analysis.ipynb: Notebook containing the data analysis.

the following are contained in the archive.zip file:
survey_results_public.csv: Stackoverflow's 2017 Annual Developer Survey data.
datasets_1406_2522_survey_results_schema.csv: Stackoverflow's 2017 Annual Developer Survey Question Schema

## Results:
> A background in computer programming helps but is not necessary <br>
> Fill the gaps in your programming skills with in demand languages <br>
> Take online courses to get hands on experience <br>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here: https://medium.com/@pzebarth/thiswill-make-you-rethink-how-to-become-a-developer-6d9fa901717e
