## Project Motivation
I was interested in using Stackoverflow Developer Survey Data to better understand:

> 1. How common is becoming a developer with a physics background? <br>
> 2. What programming languages should you focus on? <br>
> 3. How should you learn the necessary programming languages? <br>

## File Description:

Survey Analysis.ipynb: Notebook containing the data analysis. <br>

The following are contained in the archive.zip file: <br>

survey_results_public.csv: Stackoverflow's 2017 Annual Developer Survey data <br>
datasets_1406_2522_survey_results_schema.csv: Stackoverflow's 2017 Annual Developer Survey Question Schema <br>

## Results:
> 1. A background in computer programming helps but is not necessary <br>
> 2. Fill the gaps in your programming skills with in demand languages <br>
> 3. Take online courses to get hands on experience <br>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here: https://medium.com/@pzebarth/thiswill-make-you-rethink-how-to-become-a-developer-6d9fa901717e
