# Data Science Blog Post

## Project Motivation
I was interested in using Stack Overflow Developer Survey Data to better understand:

> 1. How common is becoming a data scientist or machine learning specialist with a physics background? <br>
> 2. What programming languages should I focus on to become a data scientist? <br>
> 3. How should I learn the necessary programming languages? <br>

## File Description:

Survey Analysis.ipynb: Notebook containing the data analysis. <br>

The following are contained in the zip files: <br>

survey_results_public_2017.csv.zip: Stackoverflow's 2017 Annual Developer Survey data <br>
survey_results_public_2019.csv.zip: Stackoverflow's 2019 Annual Developer Survey data <br>
survey_results_schema.csv.zip: Stackoverflow's 2019 Annual Developer Survey Question Schema <br>

## Results:
> 1. A background in computer programming is more common with physics majors making up less than 11% of data scientists <br>
> 2. Fill the gaps in your programming skills with in demand languages such as Python and SQL <br>
> 3. Take online courses to get hands on experience, traditional education is not neccessary <br>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available here:
